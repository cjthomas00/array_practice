# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel confident that I know what an Array is, and the terminology that goes with it. (i.e. element, method, square brackets, etc.)

# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I want to spend more time running some different method commands and seeing how they function with the different arrays.

# What questions do you have about Arrays?
- I don't know that I have any questions, but I'd like to see some real life examples of them being used to understand their function completely.
